Hyped is a website dedicated to connecting streetwear enthusiast. It allows people to sell and buy guaranteed authentic sneakers. It is a clone of https://www.goat.com/. 

*User Authentication*

Hyped utilizes user authentication that allows users to login and/or sign up for an account. When signed in, users are allow to leave reviews for specific products as well as delete their own review.

*Front-end*

Along with the simplistic design of the Hyped website, I also incorporated a modal to display a login/signup link, as well as carousels throughout the website to add a sleak design without needing to clutter the actual page.
