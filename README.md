*Front-end*

Along with the simplistic design of the Hyped website, I also incorporated a modal to display a login/signup link, as well as carousels throughout the website to add a sleak design without needing to clutter the actual page.

*Product Show Page*

When users select a sneaker from the index page, they will be greeted with a page that provides a larger photo of the sneaker along with the option to purchase the sneaker. Below the photo, users can see all the specific details regarding the particular photo.
